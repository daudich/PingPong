# PingPong Battle
***

## What is PingPong Battle?

This is a web based multiplayer game that I developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
Additionally, I used Node.js as a server and Socket.io for websocket programming using Express
framework. This was developed as a class project for CIS*3210 at University of Guelph.

It is just your normal Ping Pong game, except on network and using CSS3 for all its animation.

## Lessons learnt and outcome.

My original ambitious project was to extend the traditional game and allow abstract geometries
and more than 2 players to join a game. Furthermore, add a social component to the game by adding
a chat window per 'Game Room'. My plan to code in PHP also proved challenging as manually parsing
WebSockets had a fairly steep learning curve, and time wasn't something I could afford in a 3 week
dev and test timeline along with 5 other courses and a part-time job.

I am pleased though, in knowning that I at least implemented the original game. The game was
tested on Chrome and Firefox. I plan to complete this project as a personal project over the summer.
